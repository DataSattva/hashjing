# **HashJing: The Shape of Chance — An Art Manifesto**

## The Mandala of Randomness

**HashJing** is a conceptual meditation on the nature of chance and order.
We take a 256-bit string a cryptographically secure seed or the hash of any token—and turn it into a **mandala of randomness** made of 64 sectors (one per hex symbol) and four concentric rings (one per bit in the symbol).

*Mandala generated from the SHA-256 hash of the project name “HashJing”:*
`0x2b054d225d025fc24c58030bda276b16089ae21cc8aff93d2751472a98eab06c`

Each hash becomes an image; each segment, an imprint of choice—a form distilled from number.

HashJing is inspired by two threads:

* **Data inquiry** — probability, structure, statistical fluctuation;
* **The binary logic of the *Yì Jīng*** (易经), where change is mapped by 64 hexagrams.

A hash is a **casting of a unique state**. Its exact structure will *almost* never repeat.
Yet in that noise something more can emerge: symmetry, echo, quasi-order.
At such moments we do more than look—we **witness an event**. We discover an artefact.

## Division and the Indivisible

In Daoist cosmology all arises from **Wújí** (无极), the Indivisible, and unfolds as **Tàijí** (太极), the Great Division that gives birth to Yin and Yang, 0 and 1.

This is not abstraction but a **model of how difference appears**.
Paradoxically, from the indivisible springs the **moment of choice**. Where is it? Where does the universe hide its branching point?

HashJing offers no answer—it offers **a structure for contemplation**.
Instead of hypothesis—**geometry**. Instead of proof—**image**.

## Probability as Structure

Is there order inside a random mandala?

The probability that a 64-symbol hex string contains the exact rising sequence `0123456789abcdef` is

```
P = 49 × 16<sup>-16</sup> ≈ 2.7 × 10<sup>-18</sup>
```

Mathematics allows it.
Practice—almost never.
Yet the **almost impossible** can still occur.

HashJing lets us witness such coincidences and perceive them as a **structure irreducible to number**—the poetry of probability, order “just this once.”

## Conclusion

HashJing is inspired by the *Yì Jīng* yet does not imitate it.
Here the mandala is no ornament but an **archetype of randomness**.

HashJing is

* a lens for observing digital noise,
* an attempt to capture structure inside cryptographic entropy,
* a visual logic that needs no intricate decoding.
